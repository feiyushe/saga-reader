It specifies which windows are available in the app (such as main, settings, about, and various feed-related windows) and grants a comprehensive set of permissions required for core functionality including window management, webview control, event handling, shell operations, clipboard access, feed API interaction, autostart features, OS integration, and dialog usage. The schema reference ensures structural validation against the desktop-schema.json specification.",
