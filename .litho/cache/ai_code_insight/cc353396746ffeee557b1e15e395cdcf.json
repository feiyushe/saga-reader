    "detailed_description": "This component is a JSON-based internationalization (i18n) configuration file that provides English translations for the entire application's user interface. It contains structured key-value pairs grouped under semantic namespaces such as 'common', 'main', 'reader', 'aisprite', 'settings', etc., each corresponding to different parts of the application. The values include UI labels, prompts, tooltips, error messages, and form placeholders used throughout the app. This file enables multilingual support by allowing runtime switching between language packs without modifying source code. It supports dynamic content insertion via template placeholders (e.g., {name}, {length}) for contextual messaging in dialogs and notifications.",
